# MiamiBici
![](https://github.com/paulofierro/MiamiBici/blob/master/Assets/icon_76pt%402x.png)

A sample iOS app written in Swift 5 that consumes the [CitiBikeMiami](http://www.citibikemiami.com) station data and displays it on a map.

Built for my [Foraging for Data](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Miami/events/258909804/) talk at [Swift Miami](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Miami/).
